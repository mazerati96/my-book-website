            <p>Some frequencies don't just carry information, they carry intention. What started as discovery becomes revelation. A journey across six souls' lives, with one meaning.</p>

            <p>At the abyss of the observable universe, a scream cries out. And now that humanity has heard it, there's no going back.</p>

            <p class="teaser-warning">Some questions shouldn't be answered. Some doors shouldn't be opened.</p>

            <p class="teaser-climax">But when the universe itself seems to be speaking, crying, or praying...how can you possibly look away?</p>

                <h3>The Frequency Deepens</h3>
                <p>What was once a whisper becomes a roar. The quantum psalm isn't just a signal. It's a conversation. And it's been waiting for someone to respond, just as it had for eons before in another universe...</p>

                <p>The abyss isn't an ending. It's a threshold. And beyond it lies something that predates stars, galaxies, even physics as they know it.</p>

                <p>Understanding comes with a price. To hear the full song, to grasp the complete truth, something must be sacrificed. The question is: what are you willing to give?</p>

                <h3>Quantum & Faith</h3>
                <p>Where science ends and theology begins has never been clear. Book Two erases the line entirely. What if the universe isn't indifferent? What if it's been praying all along, along with us?</p>

            <h3>The Psalm Itself</h3>
            <p>It's not just data. It's not just noise. The frequency has structure, purpose, meaning. It's a song that builds against entropy. A prayer that refuses to fade.</p>

            <p>If <em>Lay Upon The Earth</em> asked what makes us human, <em>Quantum Psalm of a Dying Sun</em> asks what makes us matter in a universe that seems designed to forget us.</p>
            <p>The android found her purpose. The Brigade found their path. But the signal they discovered—the frequency humming from the black hole—had its own plans. And those plans predated humanity by eons.</p>
            <p class="connection-emphasis">Book Two is where six lives span the universe, but yet still interconnect. Where discovery becomes transformation. Where the measure of souls becomes the measure of sacrifice itself.</p>

                <h3>The Frequency Deepens</h3>
                <p>What was once a whisper becomes a roar. The quantum psalm isn't just a signal—it's a conversation. And it's been waiting for someone to respond.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Into The Black Hole</h3>
                <p>The event horizon isn't an ending. It's a threshold. And beyond it lies something that predates stars, galaxies, even physics as we know it.</p>

                <p>Understanding comes with a price. To hear the full song, to grasp the complete truth—something must be sacrificed. The question is: what are you willing to give?</p>
            </div>

                <div class="panel-icon">🔬</div>
                <h3>Quantum & Faith</h3>
                <p>Where science ends and theology begins has never been clear. Book Two erases the line entirely. What if the universe isn't indifferent? What if it's been praying all along?</p>

                <h3>Sacrifice</h3>
                <p>To understand is to lose something. To know is to be changed. Every revelation demands payment. The question is whether the price is worth the truth.</p>

                <h3>The Psalm Itself</h3>
                <p>It's not just data. It's not just noise. The frequency has structure, purpose, meaning. It's a song that builds against entropy. A prayer that refuses to fade.</p>

            <p>The android found her purpose. The Brigade found their path. But the signal they discovered—the frequency humming from the black hole—has its own plans. And those plans predate humanity by eons.</p>
